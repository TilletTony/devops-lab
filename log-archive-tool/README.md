# Log Archive Tool

In this project, you will build a tool to archive logs on a set schedule by compressing them and storing them in a new directory, this is especially useful for removing old logs and keeping the system clean while maintaining the logs in a compressed format for future reference. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with files and directories, and building a simple cli tool.

The most common location for logs on a unix based system is /var/log.

## Requirements
The tool should run from the command line, accept the log directory as an argument, compress the logs, and store them in a new directory. The user should be able to:

Provide the log directory as an argument when running the tool.
```log-archive <log-directory>```
The tool should compress the logs in a tar.gz file and store them in a new directory.
The tool should log the date and time of the archive to a file.
```logs_archive_20240816_100648.tar.gz```
You can learn more about the tar command here.

If you are looking to build a more advanced version of this project, you can consider adding functionality to the tool like emailing the user updates on the archive, or sending the archive to a remote server or cloud storage.
